# Simple Stock Trading Website

One of the two large projects I did for Harvard's CS50 online course. The project uses Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I used Flask's built-in web server to host the website.

I had to implement a website via which users can "buy" and "sell" stocks. The website allows the user to:

- Register for an account and keep all their info within the account. 

- Get quotes of stock prices, drawn automatically from Yahoo Finance.

- Buy and sell the stocks with virtual money, and add or get rid of the stocks from the account while adjusting liquidity appropriately. 

- Show an index of the current state of the user's account.

- Show a complete history of the user's actions.

- Allow the user to add virtual cash to their account.
